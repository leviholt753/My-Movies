    <p> There are many movies that have been created in the world but there are some that stick out to me more than others. Comedy
        is one of my absolute favorite genres of movies because I love comedy. Hunt for the wilder people is a classic or at least for me
        I think that the style of filmmaking is hilarious and that everyone should watch it at least once the jokes in it are so funny
        and it is just the best ever. Happy Gilmore is an Adam Sandler classic. this movie makes me laugh every time because a hockey star turned
        to gold and was even better. So sometimes I just want to laugh and not think while I watch a movie. Last but not least for comedy movies
        is Borat. This movie is an absolutely horrible movie but one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. the jokes in it are out of this world
        and the actors are hilarious.

      <p>Action movies are the best. The first one that is on my list is John Wick.  I think that the movies are absolutely amazing 
        and I think that everyone should watch them because they are so action-packed and so cool to watch and just enjoy the show.
        the next movie that I am going to talk about is Baby Driver. This movie is absolutely amazing because it combines 2 of my
        favorite things cars and music. The way that this movie was put together was absolutely amazing and it's
        just filled with cool cars and action guns and everything else. The last and final action movie I'm going to talk 
        about is Guns Akimbo, okay this one is a kind of action but it is hilarious because Daniel Radcliff had guns stuck to his hands, 
        and it is absolutely delirious but still many actions as it is in the action part of the table.

        War movies always have a special place in my heart because not only am I in the Army Nation Guard my grandpa was in the Vietnam War and my cousin was in the Marines.
        Forest Gump is like all 3 kinds of movies war action and comedy. there are so many lines that are fun to quote and it's just cool.
        I recently had the opportunity to go to Monument Valley and see the road that he was running on and it was so cool. The next movie that
        I talk about All Quite on the Western Front. This movie is absolutely amazing just because it is about how bad war is and what it can do to a young man
        but still, it was such a good movie. Last but not least who doesn't like a tank movie? I find tanks to be so neat that this movie is 
        just fun to watch and enjoy the story a bit gorry but still way cool for a war movie.
